# From-scratch-machine-learning---From-mathematical-formulas-to-functioning-algorithms

In this repository I will attempt to implement popular machine learning algorithms from their basic mathematical fundamentals to their code counterparts 
The purpose of this repository is for me to get a deeper feel and insigth of the inner workings of these algorithms, an attempt to gain a higher level of understanding, use cases , strengths and weaknesses of these many algorithms and their different implementations.
