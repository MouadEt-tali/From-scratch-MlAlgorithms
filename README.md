# From-scratch-machine-learning--From-mathematical-formulas-to-functioning-algorithms
## Repo description
In this repository I will attempt to implement popular machine learning algorithms from their basic mathematical fundamentals to their code counterparts.

The purpose of this repository is :

1. To get a deeper feel and insight to the inner workings of these algorithms.
2. An attempt to gain a higher level of understanding, use cases , strengths and weaknesses of these many algorithms and their different implementations.

At the current moment I have done Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression and i'll be continuing to update this repo more as I start delving deeper into other algorithms.
